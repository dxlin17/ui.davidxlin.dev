            <p>Hello! I'm a California transplant, currently living in Seattle working at AWS on the Kinesis Data Streams team. I am interested in building systems that can generate, stream, and ingest real-time data to train AI models. You can check out some of my personal projects at my Github.</p>
            <p>Outside of work, I like to play chess, basketball, and recently started picking up pixel art and music production as a hobby. You can see some samples I've made in the Pixel Art Gallery below.</p>
